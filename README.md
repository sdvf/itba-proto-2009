# Communications Protocols Final Project #

This project was developed at ITBA in 2009.

It is a Client-Server application that allows its users to purchase movies online. The protocols which communicate the different applications had to be new and original. The applications were developed using TCP/IP sockets.

Inside `/docs` the documentation related to this project is available. Particularly `/docs/TPesp2009.pdf` contains the project's instructions provided by the instructors and `/docs/Informe.pdf` contains the user manual and observations about the implementation (both in Spanish).
